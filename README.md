🛠️ Implementation Details
HTML

A full-width <canvas> element inside a container.

Bottom control panel with labeled controls: pen size, color button/input, undo/redo/clear buttons, pen/erase/text toggles, font <select>, and a background color control.

A toggle button for dark/light mode placed at the top-right.




CSS

Dark theme uses deep navy/dark purple background for the control panel and borders.

Rounded buttons, pill-shaped controls, and subtle shadows for a modern look.

Responsive spacing so the toolbar stays usable on wide screens.




JavaScript

Setup canvas with canvas.width/canvas.height sized to the viewport or container and handle window resize.

Mouse events: mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseout to draw strokes.

Touch events: touchstart, touchmove, touchend with e.preventDefault() for smooth drawing on touch devices.

Stroke drawing uses ctx.beginPath(), ctx.moveTo(), ctx.lineTo() and ctx.strokeStyle / ctx.lineWidth.

Undo/Redo implemented by saving canvas snapshots (toDataURL() or getImageData) into stacks.

Color picker uses native <input type="color"> or a custom color palette popup.

Text insertion: draw text on canvas using ctx.fillText() at click coordinates; optionally support an overlay input for editable text.
